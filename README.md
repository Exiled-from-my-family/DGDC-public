This director's cut is made with the intention of making the game uterly in line with it's original vision in 2020-2021.
This means not being beholden to memes nor external pressures. Nor flatley mimicking other games. This is about sincerity.

Main features
1. Cutting out the vast majority of the dialogue and scenes.
2. Changing the protagonist.
3. Cutting out "flat" levels and replacing them with scenarios and content relating to the genre of adventure, rather than action.
4. GMAX being more like an Aperture science, as in already destroyed.
5. Explores the lore more.
6. Starting out in the open world.
7. Making Webscape mandatory for progression and easy to access.
8. Simplifying everything.

AUDIO needs to be redownloaded,
and franks slash pack,
and MATERIALS,
and stylizednaturepack
and MISSIONS/ARCADE if you really want it.
